# Darktooth iTerm2 Colors

An iTerm2 color scheme based on the [emacs theme darktooth](https://github.com/emacsfodder/emacs-theme-darktooth) by [jasonm23](https://github.com/jasonm23).
Darktooth itself is based on [gruvbox](https://github.com/Greduan/emacs-theme-gruvbox) and [soothe](https://github.com/emacsfodder/emacs-soothe-theme).

So far it's only using original darktooth colors so green, yellow and magenta are the same for normal and bright.
